Teju considers the number 3 unlucky and wishes to remove the element located at the 3rd position in an array, considering the first position in the array as position 1. 

Write a program that eliminates the element at this 3rd position and then displays the modified array.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, the size of the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
After removing the element at the 3rd position, the output displays space-separated integer array values.

	int N = sc.nextInt();
    int [] arr = new int[N];
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++) {
    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();  
    }
	if(N>=3) {
		for(int i=2 ;i<N-1;i++) { // WE WILL START FRM 2 BEC WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE ELEMENT 3 .I.E WHICH MEANS THE ELEMENT WHICH WE HAVE TO REMOVE WE HAVE TO INTIALIZE THE i FRM ONE PREVOIUS INDEX.
		arr[i] = arr[i+1]; // ADDING ELEMENT TO LEFT SIDE.
}
		N--;
	}
for(int i=0;i<N;i++) {
	System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
}
